## Use as part of website or webpage builders

The use of Nodoku for the purposes to provide a solution for online (or offline) website or webpage builders is **_prohibited_**.

This prohibition includes the direct or indirect use of the Nodoku library as part of webpage builder solution.

Indirect use of Nodoku library would include building a software that would then be used as part of webpage or website builder.

Webpage or Website builder application is any tool, online or offline, that would allow the End User to build a publishable webpage or website, using no code or low amount of code.

This is prohibited under this license term since that would constitute a direct competition to Nodoku lo-code site builder.
